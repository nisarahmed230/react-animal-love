# Animals - A React Application

This is my second project in my journey of learning React. The application is named "Animals" and it's designed to highlight some extremely important concepts in React, such as the state system and event system.

### Project Description

The "Animals" application shows a button to the user that says 'Add Animals'. When the user clicks on the button, a random single picture of an animal is added to the page. The first time, it may show a picture of a horse, the second time it may add a picture of a bird, and so on. Each click adds one animal.

Next to each animal, there is a small heart icon. Anytime a user clicks on an animal, it's taken as a sign that the user likes this animal, and the little heart gets a bit larger. As the user clicks more and more, the heart keeps increasing in size.

### Project Structure

The project consists of three main JavaScript files in the `src` folder:

- `index.js`: This is the entry point of the application.
- `App.js`: This file defines the `App` component, which is the root component of the application.
- `AnimalShow.js`: This file defines the `AnimalShow` component, which represents a single animal.

### Technologies Used

- React.js
- CSS: The styling of the application is done through CSS without using any CSS framework.
